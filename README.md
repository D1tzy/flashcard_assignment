# Flashcard Project

## What is this project?

This is a project built using React, and styled with Bootstrap, that pings a database of deck and card information with pre-built routes. Using this data, and the React 
framework, the project allows the user to dynamically create, update, or delete deck and card information, with their changes being displayed on the screen.

## How do I get the project to work on my machine?

Fork this project and open it in your IDE. Open the terminal in the IDE for this project and run **npm i**. Once the packages have been installed, run **npm start**. 
After a few seconds, either one or two pages should open up. One will be **localhost:5000**, and the other will be **localhost:3000**. The first, port 5000, is the database 
with its current routes, and if you click on a route you will see the data currently there. The second, port 3000, is the front end UI.
